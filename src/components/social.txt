Create a social networking app on the solana blockchain that uses account abstraction and walletless onboarding. Architect and give a detailed explanation by creating it as an example. use the following instructions while creating it:
1. During registration, get the username, email, and password of the user and log them in with their username and password.
2. use supabase as our database.
3. Use the react-native expo library/framework for mobile development.
4. Create a smart contract wallet to handle transactions in the app using the anchor framework.
5. Create other smart contract that are neccessary for this project using the anchor framework.
6. Users can earn tokens in the app by posting contents and can spend tokens to follow other users.
7. Users can tip other users using their tokens.
8. Use node.js for backend if you feel the need to.
I don't know the best way users can buy tokens when they run out of it and can't earn it, Do you have any idea?
